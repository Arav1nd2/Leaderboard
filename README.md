Stage -1 :
This contains a basic html file which shows the structure of the login page
Stage -2 :
 This contains the same html file, but now extended by adding php elements to access the database and retreive data from the database.
 Name of database : 'leaderboard'
 Name of table : 'content'
 Name of attributes in the table : 'Name' , 'Marks'
Stage -3 :
  This is an extension of stage 2 by adding login page and add members feature for the logged in users. IN this task 2 tables are used,
  one for storing the content of the leaderboard and another one for storing the login details.
  Name of the database : 'leaderboard'
  Name of Table : 'content'
  Name of attributes in table content : 'Name', 'Marks'
  Nmae of Table : 'admin'
  Name of attributes in table admin : 'user', 'pwd'
  Since signup page has not been added yet, you have to manually give input for the admin table.
